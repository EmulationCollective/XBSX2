XBSX2 is a fork of [PCSX2](https://github.com/PCSX2/) which is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator. Its purpose is to emulate the PS2's hardware, using a combination of MIPS CPU [Interpreters](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)>), [Recompilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation) and a [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) which manages hardware states and PS2 system memory. This allows you to play PS2 games on your PC, with many additional features and benefits.

## System Requirements

We recommend to use an Xbox Series S or Xbox Series X with XBSX2 but you can however play a limited set of games on Xbox One, Xbox One S, and Xbox One X.

Please note that a BIOS dump from a legitimately-owned PS2 console is required to use the emulator. For more information, visit [this page](https://pcsx2.net/docs/setup/gather/#how-to-dump-your-ps2-bios)
